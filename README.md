## 📂 Structure of Sample Programs

This directory contains a set of demonstration examples that use the **MDNN** library for creating and training neural networks. Each example is designed to showcase a specific functionality or model configuration.

### 🖥️ Running the Samples

The sample applications are ready to be run immediately within the **Visual Studio** development environment. After copying the relevant code into an existing project, simply build and run the project.

### 📁 Contents of Each Folder

Each folder contains the following files:

- **`program.txt`** – the source code demonstrating the use of the MDNN library. Simply copy this code into the main file (`Program.cs`) of your existing project.
- **`.json` file** – a serialized neural network model trained on the given dataset. The model is ready for immediate inference without the need for retraining.
- **`dataset.csv`** *(or other format)* – the dataset used for training the model.
- **`loss_plot.png`** – a visualization of the loss function value over the training epochs.

### ✅ Recommended Workflow

1. Create a new C# project in Visual Studio.
2. Load the **MDNN.dll** library and add the necessary references.
3. Copy the code from `program.txt` into the `Program.cs` file.
4. Make sure the dataset is placed in the correct project directory if needed.
5. Run the application.

This way, you can easily test and modify different usage scenarios of the **MDNN** library according to your needs.

### 🔧 Building the ready-made project

The `MDNN_example` project references the library by **relative path** and assumes that
`MDNN` and `MDNN_examples` are cloned **next to each other**:

```
your-folder/
 ├── MDNN            <- the library
 └── MDNN_examples   <- this repository
```

```bash
cd MDNN_examples/MDNN_example/MDNN_example
dotnet run
```

If you keep the library elsewhere, edit the `ProjectReference` in the `.csproj`, or replace it
with a `Reference` + `HintPath` pointing at your own `MDNN.dll`.

Training writes `loss.png` and, with auto-save on, `AutoSave.json` into the working directory.
